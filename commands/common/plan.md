# /plan 

## Purpose
Analyze issue and create implementation plan by referencing existing code patterns.

## Agents
- **codebase-researcher**: Analyze referenced files and extract patterns
- **framework-docs-researcher**: Look up framework-specific solutions (if needed)

---

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Issue Analysis (2 min)
```bash
1. Understand the issue/requirement
2. Identify referenced files to learn from
3. Extract key patterns to apply
```

### Phase 2: Parallel Research ðŸ”€ (3 min)
```bash
# Run simultaneously
Lane 1: codebase-researcher     # Analyze referenced files
Lane 2: framework-docs-researcher  # Framework best practice (optional)
```

### Phase 3: Plan Creation (3 min)
```bash
3. Extract patterns from referenced files
4. Identify what needs modification
5. Create step-by-step implementation plan
```
