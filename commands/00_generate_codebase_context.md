in our top level folder can you make a [./.claude/llms.txt] file that gives all the information needed for all of those files? it should include the main goals for each from a high level, some additional context, but then also list all the functions w/ their params and types as well as concise explanations of functions definitely include at the end an ascii map of all of the connections between the files as well as some conclusions about the current structure, code style guide, any included data's format, and more from the perspective of a veteran software developer. Keep it concise and internalize the principle of Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
