# /react:review

Review React code and generate actionable fix checklist for next phase.

**Agents:** tak-typescript-reviewer, code-simplicity-reviewer, design-implementation-reviewer (if UI)

---

## Pre-Review

**From /plan and /implement outputs:**
1. Review Focus items from plan
2. Implementation notes from implement
3. Files created/modified list

---

## Boundaries

### ✅ Always Do
- Check ALL Critical items (auto-fail if missed)
- Provide specific file:line references
- Include fix code snippets
- Generate Fix Checklist for next phase

### ⚠️ Ask First
- Suggest major refactoring
- Recommend architecture changes

### 🚫 Never Do
- Skip Critical checks
- Give vague feedback without fix examples
- Approve code with Critical issues

---

## Workflow

1. **Setup (2min)**: Load plan's Review Focus, implement's Notes
2. **Parallel (10min)**: Feature Library | Exports/Imports | TypeScript | State
3. **Analysis (5min)**: Complexity review, over-engineering check
4. **Final (3min)**: Generate Fix Checklist, consolidate score

---

## Checks (Priority Order)

### 🔴 Critical (Auto-Fail)
1. `export default` found? → Must convert to named
2. Missing barrel exports (index.ts)?
3. Component → API direct call (bypassing hooks)?
4. `any` without justification?

### 🟡 Important
5. `useState` for shared state? (should use Zustand)
6. Props > 10? (props explosion)
7. Component > 200 lines?

### 🟢 Nice-to-have
9. Could be simpler?
10. Missing cn() for Tailwind?
11. Naming could be clearer?

---

## Decision Tree

```
Default exports/imports? → 🔴 Convert to named
Barrel exports missing? → 🔴 Add index.ts
Component → API direct? → 🔴 Use TanStack Query hooks
any without comment? → 🔴 Add types or justification
Relative imports across libs? → 🟡 Use @{projectName}/*
useState for shared state? → 🟡 Use Zustand
Component > 200 lines? → 🟡 Consider splitting
Props > 10? → 🟡 Props explosion - split component
Inline styles? → 🟢 Use Tailwind + cn()
✅ All pass → Score 10/10
```

---

## Verification Commands

```bash
# {pm} = npm, yarn, pnpm, bun (use project's package manager)
grep -r "export default" libs/{feature}/
grep -r ": any" libs/{feature}/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx"
{pm} run lint
{pm} run typecheck
```
